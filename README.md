All of these app have been written in stream lit and expect the user to upload the file

I have not been able to get the langsmith to work. If you want it to work you will need to add your API key to the bash profile with this name `LANGSMITH_API_KEY`

`ollama.py` expects you to have the ollama cli running and have a model up
`cohere_hugging_face.py`, i couldn't get the hugging face cohere to work so it is commented out and is using gpt2

`requirements.txt` has all the requirements and should get u up and running, I highly encourage that u set up a virtual env and NOT RUN THIS LOCALLY, numpy lib will mess things up and you will have to try a couple of versions before it works.

TODO: i will add the descriptions of the other files i have added so far
